# Pandas 
What is Pandas? It's a Python library used to analyze and work with data. 
A Series is like a column of a table, a DataFrame is the whole table. 
To get a specified row -> df.loc[n] or df.loc["day2"]
You can load csv files into a Pandas DataFrame with the following code:
import pandas as pd 
df = pd.read_csv("example.csv")
